This project was contributed by MS Business Analytics and Information Management students at Purdue University:
> Jai-Woo Lee, Sabitra Rudra, Su-Tien Lee, Xue Han, Yu-Lin Tai (In alphabetical order)

We created an application that enables customers to learn about wines and recommends wines that meet their preferences. 
With the wine datasets from Kaggle, we built the application consisting of three tabs: **1) Search tab where users can search wines and get information, 2) Data tab where users can explore dataset to obtain insights, and 3) Wine recommendation tab.**


We hope to enhance customersâ€™ experience when they choose wines by building our application in a way that is informative, interactive, and supportive.
